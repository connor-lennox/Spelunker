All data files use a standardized data format which is basically a header-less CSV with semicolon as the delimiter 
instead of commas. The purpose of this is to standardize the Loading pipeline so that each file type can pull from a 
common set of utilities and then interpret them as they will.

For example, the `items` dataset will have different columns than the `monsters` dataset, but both will be able to 
be parsed by the same BaseLoader class as this will have the common code for managing the data reading. How these
read fields are translated into actual ItemType and ActorType definitions is an implementation detail of the downstream
loader.
